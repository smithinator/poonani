helpPreString=These are my commands:\n\n:help: or :?: (brings up this message)\n:remindme: HR:MN PM Month dd, yyyy event; hour and day must be 2 digits, time zone must be US Central\n:addcolor: name red green blue (if there is a role above the color roles with the same name as *name* an error will occur)\n:removecolor: name (Don't delete a color just because you're done with it, someone else may like it. Only use to delete colors made with typos)\n:setcolor: name (leave name blank [or enter anything but a valid color, technically] to remove current color)\n:colors:\n:setcolorpermrole: set the role above which color commands are allowed (admin only) (having more than one role in the guild by this name will cause undefined behavior, as well as users being able to delete the other similarly-named role if the bot has permission to do so)\n:join: (Join the user's voice channel)\n:leave: (Leave the connected voice channel)\n:play: name (Play the sound file named name.mp3)\n:taunts: (View the list of available sound files)
helpPostString=\n\nFeel free to test these commands here (with the exception of color commands [and the remindme command, until I find a workaround] which must be executed within a guild).
